## 🧠 Model Architecture
- The chatbot uses a neural network with the following architecture:
- Input Layer: 5 neurons with ReLU activation
- Hidden Layers: 40 and 4 neurons with Batch Normalization
- Output Layer: Softmax activation for intent classification
- Regularization: Dropout (0.5) to prevent overfitting
- Optimizer: SGD with Nesterov momentum
- Loss Function: Categorical cross-entropy
- Training Process
    - Text Preprocessing: Tokenization and lemmatization
    - Bag-of-Words: Convert patterns to numerical vectors
    - Model Training: 200 epochs with batch size of 5
    - Intent Prediction: Probability threshold of 0.25
